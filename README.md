# todo-react
Training project to make interface with React
**React + tailwind css** 

To-do list with a *nice* design and title, date or status. 
It's also possible to quickly add, delete and edit the list of to-do's.   

It is not a fully-functioning app, since it's not connected to any database and only fetches data from todo-list.json file. It was still fun learning React this way and playing with different properties of graphic elements and functions of the components.
