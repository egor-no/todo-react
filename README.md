# todo-react
Training project to make interface with React

To-do list with sorting and filtering things in the schedule by date/time, title or status (if it's an active to-do or already done). It's also possible to quickly add, delete and edit the list of to-do's.   
This is not a fully-functioning app, since it's not connected to any database and only fetches data from data.json file. It was still fun learning React this way and playing with different properties of graphic elements and functions of the components.
