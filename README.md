# todo-react
Training project to make interface with React
**React + tailwind css** 

To-do list with a *nice* design and title, date or status. 
It's also possible to quickly add, delete and edit the list of to-do's.  

<hr>

<h3>That's how the app looks</h3><br />
<img title="To-do list" src="/img/main.jpg" alt="That's how to-do list looks" width="60%" />

<b>That's the form to add new items</b><br />
<br />
<img title="Adding a new thing" src="/img/form.jpg" alt="Form for adding a new entry"  width="60%"  />

<b>And that's the options to filter and sort items</b><br />
<br />
<img title="Fitlering items" src="/img/filter.jpg" alt="Filter the items by date and status (show only things to be done)" width="60%" /><br />
<img title="Sorting items" src="/img/sort.jpg" alt="Filter the items by search phrase and sort them by date"  width="60%" />
<br /><br />
It is not a fully-functioning app, since it's not connected to any database and only fetches data from todo-list.json file. It was still fun learning React this way and playing with different properties of graphic elements and functions of the components.
